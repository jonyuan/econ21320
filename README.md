Are People Staying at Home? Capturing the Effects of Lockdown
Policies on Mobility in the US and China

Abstract
We study mobility data gathered by Google and Baidu to measure the direct effect
that the lockdown policies had on social distancing in the United States and China. In
the United States, we specifically examine the different responses to stay-at-home orders
in counties based on their voting share (Democratic/Republican) in the 2016 election. We
find that stay-at-home orders do not have a different direct effect on more Democratic
or Republican counties, though Democratic counties were more likely to decrease mobility
before the orders were issued. The direct effect of the stay-at-home order on mobility ranges
from 2% to 13% depending on the type of district (parks, transit, grocery, retail, workplaces,
residential), only increasing in residential areas. In China, we study the mobility changes
due to different levels of lockdowns implemented across the country, ranging from complete
shutdown, like in the Hubei province, to quarantine zones and other mobility restrictions.
The initial complete lockdown was responsible for about a 70% decrease in mobile people
as a percentage of the population, and subsequent less-stringent lockdown measures did
not significantly drop mobility further. Both of these results are robust up to controls on
demographics, time, and coronavirus case numbers.
